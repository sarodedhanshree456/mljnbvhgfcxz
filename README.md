# 📘 C Programming – Semester 1

This repository contains **C programming programs and practice codes** for **Semester 1**.
It is created to help beginners **learn C programming basics**, understand **core concepts**, and prepare for **college exams and viva**.

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

> ⚠️ **Note:** All C programs are stored as **separate `.c` files** and are **not organized into folders**.
> Each file name clearly represents the **topic** it belongs to.

### 🔖 File Naming Convention

The programs follow a simple naming pattern:

* `array_*.c`
* `function_*.c`
* `loop_*.c`
* `operator_*.c`
* `pointer_*.c`
* `recursion_*.c`
* `string_*.c`
* `structure_*.c`
* `union_*.c`
* `user_function_*.c`

**Examples:**

* `array_sum.c`
* `loop_factorial.c`
* `pointer_swap.c`
* `string_reverse.c`
